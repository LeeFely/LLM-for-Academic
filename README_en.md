# A Prompt Engineering for scientific freshman to get started quickly. 
This project is produced by non-CS professional researchers, focusing on the training of local existing literature, helping laboratory newcomers / college students who have just entered the field of scientific research to quickly start the field of mentors, personalized learning AI assistant, because of copyright issues, so the follow-up will consider the summary of the unopen access article and the full text of the open access of SCI Region I journals (natural science journals) for training, this project is strictly prohibited in paper writing, at your own risk! This project is trained by the existing open source LLM, which accesses the knowledge graph and visualizes the literature content. The purpose of the project is to provide personalized knowledge services, and does not train the entire network, so it can achieve localized deployment. Note: The original model is expected to be trained on text only, and multimodality may be opened later. The author of the project is an undergraduate student from Bioscience, but the project will start one year later, after my postgraduate examination, that is, 2023/06. Due to my limited ability, I hope that developers with CS professional background will communicate with me.
